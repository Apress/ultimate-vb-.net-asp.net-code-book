Important Note
===============

Run the .EXE in the /Bin directory first to view the Windows XP themed application.

Opening in Visual Studio .NET and running the application will overwrite this .EXE and the changes made to it from steps four onward in the book.

Remember: each time you overwrite the file, you will need to follow steps four onwards, altering the XML file to match the latest version number.
