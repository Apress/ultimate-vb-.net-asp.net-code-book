To get started, simply explore the folders and open the relevant projects in VS .NET. Most have been created in VS .NET 2002, yet have been tested to easily upgrade simply by opening in VS .NET 2003.

Some projects have special setup instructions: be sure to check out the ReadMe.txt file in the folder, if available.

New tips
=========

Thousands of tips didn't make it to press because they simply didn't pack enough punch. The following list of tips didn't make it to the book... not because they weren't exciting, but because we simply couldn't fit them in. If you enjoyed the book, you'll be interested in...

 * ASP.NET: Letting the user pick a date through a pop-up window
    - Read this online article and check out the online sample from my good
    - friend, Don Carter. http://aspalliance.com/Colt/Articles/Article4.aspx

 * User Controls: You may have read my tip about using never being able to
    overuse user controls in an ASP.NET page. You can learn more about how
    to use multiple user controls on *one* Web page, showing and hiding as
    appropriate, thereby allowing you to maintain one "style" of page with
    minimum maintenance. Expand on my technique by reading the articles at
    http://www.smartisans.com/articles/vb_templates.aspx and
    http://www.fawcette.com/vsm/2001_12/magazine/columns/aspnet/default.asp
    - watch out, these articles are entirely up-to-date. For example,
    the Smartisans.com article refers to the ControlBase class, which has
    been replaced with the Control class. Keep your eye out!
